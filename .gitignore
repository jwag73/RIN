logs/ # If you have a local logs/ directory for runtime logs not meant for repo
# (Note: Your RIN project has a `rin/logs/` for telemetry JSONs.
# If those JSONs ARE meant to be committed as examples or part of the repo,
# then you might remove `logs/` from here or make it more specific like `*.runtime.log`)
# For now, assuming RIN's `rin/logs/` are for generated output you might commit example of.
# If `rin/logs/` is purely for transient logs, then `rin/logs/` or `logs/` here is fine.
# Given the RIN roadmap mentions "JSON log per run (rin/logs/yyyymmdd-HHMMSS.json)",
# these specific JSON files will be ignored if you just put `logs/` or `rin/logs/` here.
# Let's be specific and keep `rin/logs/` *out* of the .gitignore for now, assuming the plan
# implies these might be example outputs or part of what we manage,
# UNLESS you explicitly want to ignore everything in `rin/logs/`.
# For now, I'll remove the generic `logs/` and you can add `rin/logs/` if those should be ignored.
